ðŸ’° Loan Status Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the status of a loan application, determining whether it will be approved or not. The model is built using a Jupyter Notebook, which outlines the entire process from data loading to making predictions.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

You'll need the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn

How to Run

Open the Loan Status Prediction.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code).

Ensure you have the required dataset file in the same directory as the notebook.

Run all the cells sequentially to execute the full workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to making a prediction.

ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow

The notebook guides you through the entire machine learning process:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: The notebook loads the dataset and prepares the data, including handling categorical features and splitting the data for training and testing.

Model Training: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the loan status for new, unseen data.
